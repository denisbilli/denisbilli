# Hi, I’m Denis Billi 👋

**Senior Software Engineer · Applied AI / ML Research · CNC & HMI Systems**

I design and build industrial-grade software at the intersection of CNC automation, HMI systems and applied artificial intelligence.  
I have over 15 years of experience working on large-scale C++ and Python codebases for industrial machinery, CAD/CAM pipelines and real-time control interfaces.

Alongside my industrial work, I conduct independent research in computer vision, image forensics and AI system reliability.

## 🧠 Professional Focus

Most of my day-to-day work happens inside private enterprise repositories and NDA-bound environments.  
My main areas of activity include:

- Architecture and long-term maintenance of complex industrial software systems  
- Refactoring and modernization of legacy C++ codebases  
- CNC-oriented computational geometry and multi-axis kinematics  
- HMI design for safety-critical and production environments  
- Internal tooling, QA automation and applied ML for diagnostics and prediction  

This profile represents the **public-facing subset** of that work.

## 🔬 Research & Experimental Work

I maintain several research projects focused on AI robustness, interpretability and content authenticity:

- 🌓 **Spectrum Analyzer** (internal)  
  Spectral-domain methods for detecting AI-generated images versus real imagery.

- 🎞️ **StoryHash** (internal)  
  Temporal fingerprinting of video content using sequence embeddings.

- 🧩 **Vortex Engine / Neon Excape** (private)  
  An isometric voxel engine with procedural generation and simulation-oriented design.

- 🤖 **AI Agents & MLOps Tooling** (private)  
  Internal frameworks for agent-based workflows, evaluation and cost-aware inference.

Public material is released selectively when it reaches a stable and reproducible state.

## 🧠 How I Work

I focus on systems that must remain **correct, explainable and maintainable** over time.

My approach is shaped by:
- long-lived industrial software rather than short-lived prototypes  
- constraints-driven design (hardware, safety, latency, cost)  
- skepticism toward black-box solutions in production environments  
- preference for measurable improvements over theoretical elegance  

I tend to work at the boundary between  
**software architecture, mathematical modeling and real-world constraints**.

## 🧭 Engineering Values

- correctness before cleverness  
- explainability over blind optimization  
- tools must earn their complexity  
- production is the real benchmark

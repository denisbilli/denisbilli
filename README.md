# Hi there, I'm Denis Billi 👋

**Senior Software Engineer · AI/ML Researcher · CNC / HMI Specialist**

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’ve spent the last 15+ years building industrial-grade software in C++, Python, CAD/CAM, HMI development and CNC automation.  
In parallel, I conduct independent research in AI, computer vision and image forensics.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On (Behind the Scenes)

Most of my work lives inside private enterprise repositories:

* 🏗️ Complex software architectures for industrial automation  
* ⚙️ Modernization, refactoring and performance tuning of large C++ codebases  
* 📐 CNC-oriented computational geometry and advanced HMI systems  
* 🔍 Internal tools, QA automation and predictive maintenance R&D

I also maintain several private research repositories:

* 🌓 Spectrum Analyzer (AI-generated vs real image detection)  
* 🎞️ StoryHash (video fingerprinting and temporal embeddings)  
* 🧩 Vortex Engine / Neon Excape (voxel/isometric engine and procedural simulation)  
* 🤖 AI Agents and internal MLOps tooling

These private repositories represent an important part of my ongoing research.

## 📄 Publications

I publish research in image forensics, AI explainability and synthetic image detection.

* **Spectrum Analyzer: A Practical Approach to AI-Generated Image Detection**  
  Methods, benchmarks and analysis using spectral-domain techniques.  
  *(preprint / technical report)*

* **StoryHash: Towards Temporal Fingerprinting of Video Content**  
  Framework for video identity tracking using temporal embeddings.  
  *(preprint / technical report)*

More publications will be added as they become publicly available.
